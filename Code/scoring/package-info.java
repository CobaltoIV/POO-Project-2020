 * Provides the classes necessary to create an

 * The scoring framework involves two entities:
 * The edges object (@link scoring.Edges) and the alpha object(@link scoring.alpha).
 * The alpha object is used to store the information about one connections in the graph.
 * The edges object is used to store every alpha into an adjacency matrix
